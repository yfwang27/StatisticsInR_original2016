The Course
========================================================
This course introduces statistics in R and practices. It is the original version of the statistics in R course that generated in 2016.

The course consists of 3 sections; session1: data summary, session2: hypothesis testing and anova and session3: correlation and linear regression.
Each section is presented as both HTMl and Rpres markdown ( to allow for intergration of the presentation in the RStudion enviroment itself). Exercises and answer sheets are included after all subsections to practice techniques and provide future reference examples.

Course material and exercises are available to view as rendered HTML at <http://mrccsc.github.io/StatisticsInR/>.
